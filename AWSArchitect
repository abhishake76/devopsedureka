NAT Gatways are chargeable. See NAT gaeway pricing..about 0.06$ per hour

Subnet vs ROutes vs NAT vs Internet Gway vs VPC

Elastic IPs (Public IPs) are free to acquire but if they are not used for active instance, there is a panelty of 0.02$ per hr

EC2 instance soft limit for a single image ia 100. All limits are soft as they can be increased by talking to AWS.

Random  reads are done from Solid state drive and Sequential from normal Hard disk drive.
OS is deployed on SSD and DB is deployed on HD.
The terms random access and sequential access are often used to describe data files. 
A random-access data file enables you to read or writeinformation anywhere in the file. 
In a sequential-access file, you can only read and write information sequentially, starting from the beginning of the file.
Both types of files have advantages and disadvantages. If you are always accessing information in the same order, a sequential-access file is faster.
If you tend to access information randomly, random access is better. Random access is sometimes called direct access.

EC2 instance AMI cant store root data on Instance Store or EBS storage.
Instance store is ephemeral storage. 
Ephemeral storage is the volatile temporary storage attached to your instances which is only present during the running lifetime of the instance. 
In the case that the instance is stopped or terminated or underlying hardware faces an issue, any data stored on ephemeral storage would be lost
With EBS root volume is deleted on termination of EC2 instance but not across stops. 
But you can configure for root volume to be persisted even on deletion of EC2 instance.

Every AMI image has a default username

Read VPC, Submet, Route, Firewall.
Read volume mounting, RAID 0 to improve disk IO peformance.
Read file systems like XFS etc
Study type of load balancer, application layer 7, network, classic layer 4

What is Provisioned IOPs? WHat happens when you extend disk size?
Steps to attach EBS volume in /dev/xvdf
1)To check file system on new EBS volume:
  sudo file -s /dev/xvdf
  TO create xfs file system
  sudo mkfs -t  xfs /dev/xvdf
2) sudo mount /dev/xvdf/ /root/mydata
3) lsblk to see all volumes on disk

EBS can be attached to only 1 instance. EFS can be attached to mutiple instance

TO attahc EFS
1) yum install nfs-utils
2) mount -t nfs4 <efs-domainname>:/ <local-dir>/
3) Make mount permanent by making entry into /etc/fstab
   <efs-domainname>:/ <local-dir>/     nfs4   _netdev 0 0

Every image has a default user name. You can connect through ssh with key pair. 
Default username are listed at aws docs in connection prerequisites
mobaxterm is a good remote connectivity/ ssh client.

ssh on  client can use pem key with -i option, but putty will need puttyhen to generate ppk private key to connect

Snapshot lifecylce policy is chargeable.
Snapshot volumes are stored on S3 storage and are charged as per volume size.

Internal load balancer for multi tier architecture can also be created in classic load balancer.

classic load balancer works in round robin manner

Security Group is Stateful, any changes applied to an incoming rules is automatically applied to an outgoing rule. 
Network ACL is Stateless changes applied to incoming will not be applied to Security Group
Network ACL rules are applied in order, with rules with lower number processed first.

When Connection Draining is enabled, Auto Scaling will wait for outstanding requests to complete before terminating instances. 
You can enable Connection Draining via the AWS Management Console, API, or Command Line Interface (CLI), as well as AWS CloudFormation

Route 53 and traffic policy is paid service.

S3 is like google drive i.e. shared drives for sharing content
Object in S3 cannot be greater than 5 Tb in size''
in free tier we can store 5 gb of data. after 5 gb, we are charged.
S3 price depends on size of object, read write operations number, classes used, region where S3 resides

S3 replication acros region when enabled, only replicate files that are uploaded/updated after replication is activated.
