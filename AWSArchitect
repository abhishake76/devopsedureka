NAT Gatways are chargeable. See NAT gaeway pricing..about 0.06$ per hour

Subnet vs ROutes vs NAT vs Internet Gway vs VPC

Elastic IPs (Public IPs) are free to acquire but if they are not used for active instance, there is a panelty of 0.02$ per hr

EC2 instance soft limit for a single image ia 100. All limits are soft as they can be increased by talking to AWS.

Random  reads are done from Solid state drive and Sequential from normal Hard disk drive.
OS is deployed on SSD and DB is deployed on HD.
The terms random access and sequential access are often used to describe data files. 
A random-access data file enables you to read or writeinformation anywhere in the file. 
In a sequential-access file, you can only read and write information sequentially, starting from the beginning of the file.
Both types of files have advantages and disadvantages. If you are always accessing information in the same order, a sequential-access file is faster.
If you tend to access information randomly, random access is better. Random access is sometimes called direct access.

EC2 instance AMI cant store root data on Instance Store or EBS storage.
Instance store is ephemeral storage. 
Ephemeral storage is the volatile temporary storage attached to your instances which is only present during the running lifetime of the instance. 
In the case that the instance is stopped or terminated or underlying hardware faces an issue, any data stored on ephemeral storage would be lost
With EBS root volume is deleted on termination of EC2 instance but not across stops. 
But you can configure for root volume to be persisted even on deletion of EC2 instance.

HMV vs PV write more

Every AMI image has a default username

Read VPC, Submet, Route, Firewall.
Read volume mounting, RAID 0 to improve disk IO peformance.
Read file systems like XFS etc
Study type of load balancer, application layer 7, network, classic layer 4

What is Provisioned IOPs? WHat happens when you extend disk size?
Steps to attach EBS volume in /dev/xvdf
1)To check file system on new EBS volume:
  sudo file -s /dev/xvdf
  TO create xfs file system
  sudo mkfs -t  xfs /dev/xvdf
2) sudo mount /dev/xvdf/ /root/mydata
3) lsblk to see all volumes on disk

EBS can be attached to only 1 instance. EFS can be attached to mutiple instance

TO attahc EFS
1) yum install nfs-utils
2) mount -t nfs4 <efs-domainname>:/ <local-dir>/
3) Make mount permanent by making entry into /etc/fstab
   <efs-domainname>:/ <local-dir>/     nfs4   _netdev 0 0
