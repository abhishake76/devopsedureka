NAT Gatways are chargeable. See NAT gaeway pricing..about 0.06$ per hour

Subnet vs ROutes vs NAT vs Internet Gway vs VPC

Elastic IPs (Public IPs) are free to acquire but if they are not used for active instance, there is a panelty of 0.02$ per hr

EC2 instance soft limit for a single image ia 100. All limits are soft as they can be increased by talking to AWS.

Random  reads are done from Solid state drive and Sequential from normal Hard disk drive.
OS is deployed on SSD and DB is deployed on HD.
The terms random access and sequential access are often used to describe data files. 
A random-access data file enables you to read or writeinformation anywhere in the file. 
In a sequential-access file, you can only read and write information sequentially, starting from the beginning of the file.
Both types of files have advantages and disadvantages. If you are always accessing information in the same order, a sequential-access file is faster.
If you tend to access information randomly, random access is better. Random access is sometimes called direct access.

EC2 instance AMI cant store root data on Instance Store or EBS storage.
Instance store is ephemeral storage. 
Ephemeral storage is the volatile temporary storage attached to your instances which is only present during the running lifetime of the instance. 
In the case that the instance is stopped or terminated or underlying hardware faces an issue, any data stored on ephemeral storage would be lost
With EBS root volume is deleted on termination of EC2 instance but not across stops. 
But you can configure for root volume to be persisted even on deletion of EC2 instance.

Read VPC, Submet, Route, Firewall.
Read volume mounting, RAID 0 to improve disk IO peformance.
Read file systems like XFS etc
Study type of load balancer, application layer 7, network, classic layer 4

What is Provisioned IOPs? WHat happens when you extend disk size?
Steps to attach EBS volume in /dev/xvdf
1)To check file system on new EBS volume:
  sudo file -s /dev/xvdf
  TO create xfs file system
  sudo mkfs -t  xfs /dev/xvdf
2) sudo mount /dev/xvdf/ /root/mydata
3) lsblk to see all volumes on disk

EBS can be attached to only 1 instance. EFS can be attached to mutiple instance

TO attahc EFS
1) yum install nfs-utils
2) mount -t nfs4 <efs-domainname>:/ <local-dir>/
3) Make mount permanent by making entry into /etc/fstab
   <efs-domainname>:/ <local-dir>/     nfs4   _netdev 0 0

Every image has a default user name. You can connect through ssh with key pair. 
Default username are listed at aws docs in connection prerequisites
mobaxterm is a good remote connectivity/ ssh client.

ssh on  client can use pem key with -i option, but putty will need puttyhen to generate ppk private key to connect

Snapshot lifecylce policy is chargeable.
Snapshot volumes are stored on S3 storage and are charged as per volume size.

Internal load balancer for multi tier architecture can also be created in classic load balancer.

classic load balancer works in round robin manner

Security Group is Stateful, any changes applied to an incoming rules is automatically applied to an outgoing rule. 
Network ACL is Stateless changes applied to incoming will not be applied to Security Group
Network ACL rules are applied in order, with rules with lower number processed first.

Cosnideration for customer for cloud deployment
a)Choose Region based on
  1) Budget
  2) Low Latency for
     1. End Users
     2. Content team/Developers: CloudFront CDN, Transfer Acceleration Service : Service to Speed up data transfer from one region to another
  3) Compliance 
     As part of compliance customer may have to deploy in region that they serve

b) Choose zones
  1) S3- replicated by default
  2) For others we need to configure zone and it has cost impact
  

AWS CLI: download it from aws website
start with following commands
command: aws configure
enter access key id
enter secret access key
enter default region name id



Zone id url: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html
Everything will be defined in default region name unless specified otherwise

Only cost budget is free on Set your budget for Amazon Billing service
Other budget types are paid service.

S3
1) Buckets: Unlimited size
2) Objects - Unlimited objects. Max object size 5 TB.
3) 5 Gb of totally free tier monthly usage
4) Object size limit is 5 TB. In a single put command, you can upload only 5GB object size. 
If you have objects more than 100 GB, we have to use multi-part upload.



S3 Pricing is based on 5 factors
1) Volume
2) Storage class
    a) Standard: Frequently used files
    b) standard Infrquent Access(IA)
    c) One zone IA
    d) Glacier
    e) Glaicier Deep Archive
    f) Intelligent tiering
3) Number of requests
4) Time period
5) Region

Delete marker is marked only for files with versioning enabled.
Without versioning file will be directly deleted from S3.

We dont want old versioned system to be of active storage.
Use lifecycle versioning to control storage class for old version'


Cross region Replication happens within 15 minutes
Versioning needs to be enabled for CRR
S3 managememnt metrics is paid.
S3 analyctics is free

Get Object policy will allow to read every object in S3
For policy defnition, principal is arn of exisinting AWS IAM user
CORS configuration allow to configure crosss domain call

Three type of purchaing option option
1) On Demand Instance preferrred for short term requriement
2) Reserved Instance: for long duration commitment. Billing for Reserved is much lower than On Demand
   If paid whole upfornt than discount is most. If paid partially or in isntallements, then price will be more than full upfront
    There is also a convertible plan where you can ove from 1 instance type to other woth adjustment in price
3) Spot instance


In E2 instanc creation, we have placement group to make simialr changes to group of ec2

Tenancy are of 2 types:
1) Shared: when we share single instance is used to host multiple application. low performance and shared resources
2) Dedicated: whole hardware for your own instance for 2$/hr extra


SSD storage: good for Randowm Access
a General Purpose SSD:  100-3000 IOPS 
b Provisioned IOPS SSD: upto 64000 IOPS
IOPS - Input Output per second


HDD storage: good for sequential access
cheaper than SSD
1) Throughput Optimized
2) Magnetic
Throughput: Rate of Data transfer

Aftering attaching a new disk voumne to EC2 instance, you need to mount new volume in EC2 instance OS
How to mpount external volume in Ec2:
1) lslbk to show all attached volumes
2) sudo mkfs -t ext4 /dev/xvdf to format and create file structure on new volume
3) sudo mount  /dev/xvdf /root/newmount
4) df -h to see data for different volumes


EFS  3x Price EBS
EFS 20x Price S3
Multi AZ, pay only what you use, same as S3
Unlike EBS, you can have multiple mount points in different AZ for same EFS. Transfer EFS file based on NFS protocol with Amazon DataSync

In IAM, user permissions is superior than group
For a group, you can add max 10 users. WHy this limitation?
IAM is global service.
No hierarchy of groups.
Permission are attached to user with either AWS managed policy or custom managed policy
Permission boundary control/limits the maximum set of  permissions policy an user can have
Permission Boundary is recommended  to be set with custom policy set


EC2 -> Elastic Compute Cloud
aws calculator: chekc price for each service and compare prices with azure or GCP

Default user for all EC2 instances is ec2-user.
to connet to intance give advacned full access for pem file from amazon to logged in admin user
Disable inheritance on pem file in security settings and add permission for only akumar1 user
basically we have to ensure key is not publicly available and logged in user have full access otherwise connection will not go through
and then ssh as
ssh -i C:\Users\akumar1\Downloads\awskey19_11.pem ec2-user@<public ip>
Once you login, you see private ip address on bash shell

YOu can put above commands in User Data of Step 3 in Create Instance
1st line should be to enable bash. no need for sudo as ec2 mahcine in background will be launched with root access.
#!/bin/bash

To Create AMI Create IMage from Instances and templates(right click on instance name).
Select AMI and click launch to have new instance with custom AMI
To delete AMI you can DeRegister AMI from AMI list.
Modify AMI -> Image Permissions to make image public


On stopping of instance public ip goes away but private ip remains same

Default limit is 5 elastic staic ip per account
Create Elastic IP and then associate Elastic IP to EC2 instance


Instance: 
1. On Demand Instances: Short Workload, predictable pricing 
2. Reserved: Minimum of 1 to 3 : Long workload
 ------sub cat:
a) Reserved 
b) Convertible Reserved inSTANCES - flexible 
c) Scheduled R I - eg: fRIDAY 3 pm to 8 pm 
3. Spot Instance: Short Workload, cheap in pricing, can loose an instance (less reliable)
4. Dedicated Instance : No other customer will share your hardware aws data
5. Dedicated Host
