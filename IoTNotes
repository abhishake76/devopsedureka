With sensehat on pi 4, pi does not boot up without a hdmi connectivity.
Hack
# uncomment if hdmi display is not detected and composite is being output
hdmi_force_hotplug=1

SPU is data acquistion system

Fritzing creates chip printed circuits by generating circuit diagrams from hardware setup like adruno board, led , resistors etc 

Microcontroller is used with this printed circuit chip to make a complete sensor

arduino nano, uno ,mega and node xu(wifi) are mega controllers.

You can mount bluetooth module and similar other modules to arduino micro controller.
Alll sensors you can attach to this micro controoler.

Then program micro controller to read data from sensors and act on them.

Arduino IDE software is used for programming audriono micro controller in C.
Sensors come with C libraries which can be used to read data.

program ca be uploaded from this ide to arduino board.
you can see output of sensor in ide console.

PIR sensor for infrared spectrum reading

sense hat is fit on gpio pins. General purpose input output pins
You can control voltage in each pin with a program on rapberry pi.

I can switch the ked by supplying 3v from gpio pin.

If i need to run motor of 12 volts, there is not enough power from pi that can be given to motor.
We use motor shield for this puropse with relays on top of pi with 12 volt power supply.

Shields have their own memory EEP ROM. The funtions of shields are already defined in shield.
SHield has 2 important properties seiral data (ID_SD) and serial clock(ID_SC).
As soon as shield is put on top of pi, it start drawing power from pi
And through data and clock pins, shielids like HAT will push inbuilt programs (dtf code) to pi.
Pi use these program functions to run shield functions.

Shields are used mostly for development.
And then design is productized as chips or cheaper solution with transistors/resistors.

install sense hat emulator, if required
sudo apt-get install python-sense-emu python3-sense-emu python-sense-emu-doc sense-emu-tools -y

You import different lib for sense hat and sense emu
sense hat: from sense_hat import SenseHat
sense emulator: from sense_emu import SenseHat
