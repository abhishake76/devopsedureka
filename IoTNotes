With sensehat on pi 4, pi does not boot up without a hdmi connectivity.
Hack
# uncomment if hdmi display is not detected and composite is being output
hdmi_force_hotplug=1

SPU is data acquistion system

Fritzing creates chip printed circuits by generating circuit diagrams from hardware setup like adruno board, led , resistors etc 

Microcontroller is used with this printed circuit chip to make a complete sensor

arduino nano, uno ,mega and node xu(wifi) are mega controllers.

You can mount bluetooth module and similar other modules to arduino micro controller.
Alll sensors you can attach to this micro controoler.

Then program micro controller to read data from sensors and act on them.

Arduino IDE software is used for programming audriono micro controller in C.
Sensors come with C libraries which can be used to read data.

program ca be uploaded from this ide to arduino board.
you can see output of sensor in ide console.

PIR sensor for infrared spectrum reading

sense hat is fit on gpio pins. General purpose input output pins
You can control voltage in each pin with a program on rapberry pi.

I can switch the ked by supplying 3v from gpio pin.

If i need to run motor of 12 volts, there is not enough power from pi that can be given to motor.
We use motor shield for this puropse with relays on top of pi.
The relays increase the voltage from 3v to 12 v

Shields have their own memory EEP ROM. The funtions of shields are already defined in shield.
SHield has 2 important properties seiral data (ID_SD) and serial clock(ID_SC).
As soon as shield is put on top of pi, it start drawing power from pi
And through data and clock pins, shielids like HAT will push inbuilt programs (dtf code) to pi.
Pi use these program functions to run shield functions.

Shields are used mostly for development.
And then design is productized as chips or cheaper solution with transistors/resistors.

install sense hat emulator, if required
sudo apt-get install python-sense-emu python3-sense-emu python-sense-emu-doc sense-emu-tools -y

You import different lib for sense hat and sense emu
sense hat: from sense_hat import SenseHat
sense emulator: from sense_emu import SenseHat

Python reference
w3school python programming
use raspberry pi ide idle(builtin), thonny(builtin) or pycharm

Sense Hat API link

Strong board ESP8266 with wifi and act as computer
PLace it on top of node mcu. You can power it with 3 batteries generating 4.5 v
So any sensor like BLC with serial connection and no internet connectivity can be plougged with node mcu to get internet connectivity


MGD is popular media server for video handling

vnc username/password for raspberry is:
username: pi
password: abhi  (default: raspberry)
port: 3389 is default port for vnc

use firefox ESR for elenium on automation on raspberry pi

use port forwarding on wifi router to connect to raspberry pi application.

Volatile memory is computer storage that only maintains its data while the device is powered. ... 
Volatile memory contrasts with non-volatile memory, which does not lose content when power is lost. 
Non-volatile memory has a continuous source of power and does not need to have its memory content periodically refreshed.

RFID has non volatile memory wiht some programmable logic in IC to transmit/receive data.
when rfid antenana coil is subjected to magnetic field, it induces electrcity.
This current passed to IC on RFID and it transmits data with programming logic after receiveing current.

Active RFID tag will have battery powered circuit for longer range transmission.

Battery assisstive Passive tag is one where battery is there but only activated once RFID comes near a reader

Motor/actuator helps in physical movement of things
Tower Pro and Servo motor are two strong small motors.
Servo motots has fast moving motors and lot of gears.
These mitiple gear wheels converts lot of speed into a high toruque.

Sensor helps in sensing/reading data from things

MQTP and AMQP: AMQP is queing based protocol whereas MQTP is send message and forget kind of protocol

CloudMQTT.com platform to do IOT communication which provides endpoint to enable communication.

MGD is a media server
Azuere IOT hub can handle inense data with thousands of IOT whereeas MQTT is lightweight for mmore quick communication.

HiveMQ is free end point provider.


MosquiotMQTTBroker is a popular messsage broker which you can install on your computer or Pi for IOT communication


Say through a prorgam you send a message to microprocessor or microcontroller to switch on light, The MP/MC is connected to sensor thorugh pin.
THe MP/MC will send  voltage to a pin which trigger the relay and relay will switch on light.
The relay just complete the circuit. The motor will have its own independent power.
Transistor can also be used in place of relay. But relays are more reliable and does not heatup as muc as transistors.
