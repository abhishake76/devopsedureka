Fritzing creates chip printed circuits by generating circuit diagrams from hardware setup like adruno board, led , resistors etc 

Microcontroller is used with this printed circuit chip to make a complete sensor

arduino nano, uno ,mega and node xu(wifi) are mega controllers.

You can mount bluetooth module and similar other modules to arduino micro controller.
Alll sensors you can attach to this micro controoler.

Then program micro controller to read data from sensors and act on them.

Arduino IDE software is used for programming audriono micro controller in C.
Sensors come with C libraries which can be used to read data.

program ca be uploaded from this ide to arduino board.
you can see output of sensor in ide console.
