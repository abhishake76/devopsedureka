UMTS is standard for CDMA technology
LTE is standard for 4g technology

R*T is receiver * transmitter in MIMO
4*2 means 4 receiver and 2 transmitter


Diversity gain is the increase in signal-to-interference ratio due to some diversity scheme, 
or how much the transmission power can be reduced when a diversity scheme is introduced, without a performance loss. 
Diversity gain is usually expressed in decibels, and sometimes as a power ratio.

In telecommunications, a diversity scheme refers to a method for improving the reliability of a message signal 
by using two or more communication channels with different characteristics

Cognitive radio (CR) is a form of wireless communication in which a transceiver can intelligently 
detect which communication channels are in use and which are not, and instantly move into vacant channels 
while avoiding occupied ones.

Cognition is defined as 'the mental action or process of acquiring knowledge and understanding 
through thought, experience, and the senses
