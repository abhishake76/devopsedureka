1 subscription tied to 1 tenant
1 tenant can have mutiple subscriptions
Email account cna be tied to different subscriptions
We can move subscription between tenants


If I have two active directory forest on prem,
then ideally I can syncronize 1 on prem AD to 1 AD tenant on  cloud.

AD forest is database of users/group/computers/OUs(Org units) etc


2 models of deploymnet
1) ARM Model: Reource manager model:latest with json support
2) Classic model: Azure Service manager model: older with xml

1 resource will always be part of 1 resource group. 
Resource can be created in 1 resource group logical container
Resource can be moved from 1 resource group to other resource group.


RBAC: Role based access control be put for resource, resource group and subsription but not on tenant
