Dimensions/Table data are discrete data which cannot be broken in deciemal and no mathematical calculation makes ssense
Measures are continuous data and all mathematical stat methods can be used on it.

tabaleau packaged workbook twbx  will have evrything like data, graph,  visualization etc
tableau workbook twb will only have graph visualization etc but no data. so you need to share data also.
so save workbook in twbx format 

with tableau public you can share data in public folder on web but do not save any sensitive data as work is visible to everyone

  
WHAT ARE JOINS ?

1) INNER JOIN : COMMON OBSERVATIONS FROM BOTH THE TABLE : 

2) LEFT JOIN : ALL OBS FROM LHS TABLE AND ONLY MATCHING FROM RHS TABLE :

3) RIGHT JOIN : ALL OBS FROM RHS TABLE AND ONLY MATCHING FROM LHS TABLE : 

4) FULL JOIN : ALL OBS FROM BOTH THE TABLE , WHETHER MATCHING OR NOT : 

WHAT HAPPENS AFTER MERGING THE TABLES : 

OBS NO REMAINS SAME BUT VAR INCREASES : 

CONDITIONS: THERE MUST BE UNIQUE OR PRIMARY KEY IN YOUR DATSETS 

VAR NAME MUST BE DIFFERENT IN BOTH THE DATASETS 

WHAT IS APPENDING ? 

WHAT HAPPENS ONCE YOU APPEND ? 

OBS NO INCRESAES WHILE VAR REMAINS SAME 

CONDITIONS: THERE MUST BE SAME VARIABLE NAME IN BOTH THE DATASETS 


Data Blending is aggregation of data from two different source/queries
One is orimary dat source and other datasource is secondary

When you selecte data source with mutiple files, drag table in data source tab into right upper data area.

The file that you slect first for mesaure drop is considered as primary data source.
Sometime text attached to field might put valuein table/dimension  instead of measure. eg $ sign in front of cost. So remove $ sign and it will come in fornt of measure.


Highlights tab in show me is enabled if you have dimenison dropped in Rows and measure just selected in left hand data selection panel
In highlights, all fields will show same color with highest concnetration on max value.
-ve value will have different color.

Measure names gives all mesaures as columns when dragged in  column
You can also drop Mesaure names in filter to filter on measure name
Mesaure values gives all mesaure values when dragged in text ara labels


You can higlisght from measure value in Marks/Text area. Click on Measure and choose highlight
You can drop mesaures in Mark area different categories like color, size, label, detail, tooltip


stacked bar char: on top of each other
grouped bar chart: beside each other or next to each other


hyper extension in prep builder can support more data
Initially there was nly tde extension type in prep.
Both extension can be openend in Tableau desktop
prep can help you to rpepare data and visualization will be done in tableau desktop

Paritioning of data means dividing data into segments
Addressing means directionality of data calculation.
so addressing is either row wise or column wise calculation...
and expectation is that for row wise, each row has equal total value...
and for column wise each column has equal total value
Edit table calculation will give you option to show you adressing across or topdown 


Aggregate calculation at level of detail is LOD
LOD is always start with curly braces in calulation panel
