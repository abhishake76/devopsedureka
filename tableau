Dimensions/Table data are discrete data which cannot be broken in deciemal and no mathematical calculation makes ssense
Measures are continuous data and all mathematical stat methods can be used on it.

tabaleau packaged workbook twbx  will have evrything like data, graph,  visualization etc
tableau workbook twb will only have graph visualization etc but no data. so you need to share data also.
so save workbook in twbx format 

with tableau public you can share data in public folder on web but do not save any sensitive data as work is visible to everyone

  
WHAT ARE JOINS ?

1) INNER JOIN : COMMON OBSERVATIONS FROM BOTH THE TABLE : 

2) LEFT JOIN : ALL OBS FROM LHS TABLE AND ONLY MATCHING FROM RHS TABLE :

3) RIGHT JOIN : ALL OBS FROM RHS TABLE AND ONLY MATCHING FROM LHS TABLE : 

4) FULL JOIN : ALL OBS FROM BOTH THE TABLE , WHETHER MATCHING OR NOT : 

WHAT HAPPENS AFTER MERGING THE TABLES : 

OBS NO REMAINS SAME BUT VAR INCREASES : 

CONDITIONS: THERE MUST BE UNIQUE OR PRIMARY KEY IN YOUR DATSETS 

VAR NAME MUST BE DIFFERENT IN BOTH THE DATASETS 

WHAT IS APPENDING ? 

WHAT HAPPENS ONCE YOU APPEND ? 

OBS NO INCRESAES WHILE VAR REMAINS SAME 

CONDITIONS: THERE MUST BE SAME VARIABLE NAME IN BOTH THE DATASETS 


Data Blending is aggregation of data from two different source/queries
One is orimary dat source and other datasource is secondary

When you selecte data source with mutiple files, drag table in data source tab into right upper data area.

The file that you slect first for mesaure drop is considered as primary data source.
Sometime text attached to field might put valuein table/dimension  instead of measure. eg $ sign in front of cost. So remove $ sign and it will come in fornt of measure.
