Transparent Data Encrytion TDE is available wtih Data Stack and not Apache Casandra 

COnsistency can be finetuned at every transaction level


read hinted hand out on cordinator node in cassandra
hint default pile up time to replicate is 3 hours. 
after configured time, new hint data is not accepted and not replicted
beyond hint period, we cna run node tool repair to make each node have latest copy of  data.


tombstone is soft delete for file marked for deletion
tombstone expirey time be default is 10 days.
gr_grace_seconds is property for tombstone expiry
after this period, casandra deletes the files.
once data is marked for delete, you cannot retrieve that data from application

if node is down from more than gr_grace_periods, dont run node tool repair but instead rebuild your node
because when node is back uo it is a possibility that old data on those nodes are replicated to other nodes.
this data is called zombie data.
Rebuild node will means fresh data is replicated on this node from other nodes.

Read repair is another way to achieve the eventual consistency.

casandra nevers read before write, it never throws constraint violation exception
it will overide values, if required.
