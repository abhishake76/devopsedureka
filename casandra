2 popular distribution of Casandra:
1) Data Stack Enterprise DSE Casandra
2) Appache Casandra

Toad supports Casandra as UI client
Data Stack client

Transparent Data Encrytion TDE is available wtih Data Stack and not Apache Casandra 

COnsistency can be finetuned at every transaction level


read hinted hand out on cordinator node in cassandra
hint default pile up time to replicate is 3 hours. 
after configured time, new hint data is not accepted and not replicted
beyond hint period, we cna run node tool repair to make each node have latest copy of  data.


tombstone is soft delete for file marked for deletion
tombstone expirey time be default is 10 days.
gr_grace_seconds is property for tombstone expiry
after this period, casandra deletes the files.
once data is marked for delete, you cannot retrieve that data from application

if node is down from more than gr_grace_periods, dont run node tool repair but instead rebuild your node
because when node is back uo it is a possibility that old data on those nodes are replicated to other nodes.
this data is called zombie data.
Rebuild node will means fresh data is replicated on this node from other nodes.

Read repair is another way to achieve the eventual consistency.

casandra nevers read before write, it never throws constraint violation exception
it will overide values, if required.

In CAP tehorem, Casssandra lies in AP part as consistentcy thorugh provided and tunable but not guaranteeed across

If consistency ALL is selected, then availability becomes a challenge.
so we use one for low consistency or chorum to read/write from majority of replicas.
use chorum for better consistency both in read and write

CQL and Thrift are just data reprentations to client. Data structure is same for both i.e. column family.
Thrift is now depricated after version casandra 2.1.8
But it can represent raw cassandra data model, so you need this client to understand casabdra version.

Casandra CLI is client for Thrift... CQLsh is client for SQL.

partiionkey column is part of primary key that is responsbile for sharding of data.
Thats why 1 column is required to be defined as primary key.
so select * from emp is not good as it will have no primary key/partiioner key to find out nodes for reading/writing
and this statement will go to all nodes.
Primary Key  has Parition key + clustering column(s)
parition key cna be combination of more than pone columns
partition key is used for creating storage partition
Clustering column is used for clustering of data and sorting of data at storage/paritionlevel

primary key ( (partion key1, partition key 2,..), clustering key 1, clustering key 2,...)


At raw level, data is shown as hexadceimal value in thrift cli 

With primary key as one field, the partition will be based on unique primary key.
With primary key as two columns, one partition key and second clustering column, the parition will be made on unique partiion key.
Each partition can be stored only on one node and dstributed across nodes
Line with name but empty value  is new line for display of Thrift

unit of data is partition...and partition is located by partition key
adjust your data model as per queries so that minimum parition are queried
partition size is limited by memory of node memory size.
So Volume of data is a important consideration for casandera data modeling
Bucketing is generally used to control parition size with a possible changing column or dummy bucket id as part of parition key.
